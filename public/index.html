				<h2>Inspiration</h2>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
					The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the
					largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. Over
					time, however, it dilapidated into nothing but ash and rubble. The
					Internet is the Library of Alexandria of our era, yet we take for
					granted just how vulnerable it is. Even with solar flares, natural
					disasters, and DDoS attacks aside, valuable knowledge is removed from
					the internet every day. Servers don't run for free, after all.
					Archive.org does a lot of great work in this space, but it is
					dangerous for our civilization to be so dependent on a centralized
					source. Arweave poises an opportunity to decentralize, and thereby
					secure the greatest library of our time. The purpose of this project
					is to capture that opportunity.
