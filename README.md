# Usage & Deployment
## Client 
If you only want to build an archive front-end, don't worry about setting up up a server. Simply send queries to https://alexandriasrevenge.herokuapp.com/graphql and you're good to go. <br> The production GraphQL Playground & Documentation (at [/graphql](https://alexandriasrevenge.herokuapp.com/graphql)) makes it a piece of cake! üéÇüç∞


## Server 
Looking to spin up the backend? That's a piece of cake too. 
<!-- #### Heroku
Smash this Deploy button! 
<br>
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy) -->
### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mccallofthewild/alexandrias-revenge.git
```
### Install the `node_modules`
```
yarn
```
or 
```
npm i
```
### Configure Wallet
Move an Arweave JWK wallet into the root directory of the project. Name it `wallet.json`.
Create a file named `env.json`. Fill it with:
```
{
	"WALLET_FILE_SECRET": "yourcomplexandcryptographicallysecurepassword"
}
```
`WALLET_FILE_SECRET` is used to encrypt your wallet when you deploy it to the server and push it to your git repository. Ensure that it is long, complex, random and secure. Both `wallet.json` and `env.json` are in `.gitignore`, and thereby will not be made public in git.

From the command line, run:
```
yarn dev
```
This simultaneously starts the server and updates the encrypted wallet (`wallet.json.enc`) to be your Arweave wallet encrypted with your password.

### Host
Publish to Heroku, or your host of choice.
Set the following environment variables accordingly:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>NODE_ENV</th>
    <th>production</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WALLET_FILE_SECRET</td>
    <td>yourcomplexandcryptographicallysecurepassword</td>
  </tr>
</table>
